## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze the NYC CitiBike data in order to provide information on bike sharing trends to investors looking to begin a bike-sharing proram in Des Moines, Iowa. From the given dataset, various visualizations were created in order to understand the relationship between who was using the bike sharing service, when they were using it, and for how long. Specifically, the following trends were visualized in various graphs:

* Popular start locations
* Peak hours for biek sharing
* Trip duration
* Number of bike trips broken down by gender and day of the week
* Frequency of bike trips broken down by customer vs subscriber

## Results
The results of the analysis are shown in the following visualizations. These visualizations can also be viewed on the Tableau story (link provided above).

## Summary
### Summary of Current Analysis
Given that New York City is a popular tourist destination, it might be surprising to observe that the bike sharing service is likely used by commuters rather than tourists. This analysis is supported by various pieces of data. For example, peak hours for bike sharing coincide with the start and end of a typical work day (8 AM & 6 PM). Additionally, it is evident that subscribers use the service more frequently than customers. In the context of bike sharing, a subscriber is someone who pays for the service on a recurring basis while a customer uses the service as a one time purchase. Subscribers are likely to be commuters where customers are likely to be tourists. Additionally, trip duration data reveals that the service is mostly used for 20 minutes are less and that males seem to use the service much more frequently than other genders. 

As a result of this analysis, the following suggestions are given to the investors seeking to start a similar service in Des Moines:
* Market the service to commuters
* Place stations within 10 minutes of each other
* Place a greater number of stations near commercial districts
* More marketing resources should be devoted to females to help increase the frequency that they use the service

### Future Analysis
Additional data could provide even more insights. The following data collection and visualizations are recommended for future consideration:
* Start / Stop location based on client type (subscriber vs customer)
* Most popular paths (start and stop locations frequently paired together)

This data might already be available. If it is not, it is recommended to collect it. Knowing if there are popular paths can help CitiBike ensure that there are sufficient amounts of bikes in these areas to accomodate the expected volume. Understanding where popular start and stop locations based on client type may help with marketing efforts and determining what types of bikes to provide in each location. The needs of each client type are different and tailoring the experience at each location may help increase usage of the service.
